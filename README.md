# Offline-Attendance-System
Project Description

-OAS is an attendance-taking system developed for instructors who use paper-based systems currently. 
-The system imports student names from a CSV file and makes teachers mark attendance through a simple command-line interface. 
-Key feature: Attendance is recorded as dated CSV files to be used afterwards.
-The solution decreases wastage of paperworks, makes it more precise, and simulates integration with a university database in a beginner-friendly approach.
